# Ribbon ðŸŽ€

Ribbon makes newline-delimited files easy to work with.

Let's say you have a huge newline-delimited JSON file that can't fit into memory.

```js
{"name": "Jessie", "age": 30}
{"name": "Kelly", "age": 40}
{"name": "Loren", "age": 50}
// Several hundred thousand more lines...
```

Ribbon can help you read it line-by-line:

```ts
import { DelimitedJSONGenerator } from "@sister.software/ribbon"

interface Person {
	name: string
	age: number
}

const reader = DelimitedJSONGenerator.fromAsync("example.jsonl")

for await (const line of reader) {
	console.log(line) // {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, etc.
}
```

# Installation

```bash
yarn add @sister.software/ribbon
# or
npm install @sister.software/ribbon
```

# Usage

## Character-delimited files

While Ribbon supports any delimited byte stream, it's particularly useful for character-delimited content such as comma-separated values (CSV), tab-separated values (TSV) â€“ or any other delimiter you can think of.

```csv
Full Name, Occupation, Age
Morgan, Developer, 30
Nataly, Designer, 40
Orlando, Manager, 50
```

```ts
import { CSVGenerator } from "@sister.software/ribbon"

const reader = CSVGenerator.fromAsync("people.csv")

for await (const columns of reader) {
	console.log(columns) // ["Full Name", "Occupation", "Age"], ["Morgan", "Developer", 30], etc.
}
```

CSV files can also be emitted as objects with headers as keys, with some quality-of-life features, such as normalizing property keys:

```ts
import { CSVGenerator } from "@sister.software/ribbon"

interface Person {
	full_name: string
	occupation: string
	age: number
}

const reader = CSVGenerator.fromAsync<Person>("people.csv", { mode: "object" })

for await (const columns of reader) {
	console.log(columns) // { full_name: "Morgan", occupation: "Developer", age: 30 }, etc.
}
```

## Advanced usage

Ribbon is designed to be simple to use, but also flexible and powerful.
For more advanced use cases, check out our tests in the `test` directory, or our fully-annotated source code.

### Reading from a stream

All Ribbon generators implement the `Generator` and `AsyncGenerator` interfaces, so you can use them in `for...of` and `for await...of` loops, as well the web-native [ReadableStreams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream), so you can use them in `for await...of` loops, as well as piping them through transformations to avoid nested and partially materialized streams.

```ts
import { DelimitedJSONGenerator } from "@sister.software/ribbon"

const people = [
	{ name: "Alice", age: 30 },
	{ name: "Bob", age: 40 },
	{ name: "Charlie", age: 50 },
]

const generator = DelimitedJSONGenerator.from(people.map(JSON.stringify).join("\n"))
const stream = ReadableStream.from(generator)

for await (const line of stream) {
	console.log(line) // {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, etc.
}
```

### Custom generators

While Ribbon includes premade exports for most use-cases, custom generators can be created via `DelimitedGenerator`. This class is a low-level interface that allows you to create your own generators for any kind of delimited content.
