# What is Ribbon?

Ribbon makes newline-delimited files easy to work with.

Let's say you have a newline-delimited JSON file called `example.csv`:

```json
{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
{"name": "Bob", "age": 40}
{"name": "Charlie", "age": 50}
```

LineReaders extend native [ReadableStreams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream), so you can use them in `for await...of` loops:

```ts
import { LineReader } from "@sister.software/ribbon"

const reader = new LineReader("example.csv")

for await (const line of reader) {
	console.log(line.toString())
}
```

# Installation

```bash
yarn add @sister.software/ribbon
# or
npm install @sister.software/ribbon
```

# Usage

## Character-delimited files

While Ribbon supports any line-delimited file, it's particularly useful for character-delimited content such as comma-separated values (CSV), tab-separated values (TSV) â€“ or any other delimiter you can think of.

```csv
Full Name, Occupation, Age
Jessie, Developer, 30
Kelly, Designer, 40
Loren, Manager, 50
```

```ts
import { LineReader, DelimiterTransformer, Delimiter } from "@sister.software/ribbon"

const reader = new LineReader(fileHandle).pipeThrough(
	new DelimiterTransformer({
		delimiter: Delimiter.Comma,
	})
)

for await (const columns of reader) {
	console.log(columns) // ["Full Name", "Occupation", "Age"]
}
```

Ribbon also includes some quality-of-life features, such as normalizing CSV headers:

```ts
import { LineReader, DelimiterTransformer, Delimiter, normalizeColumnNames } from "@sister.software/ribbon"

const reader = new LineReader(fileHandle).pipeThrough(
	new DelimiterTransformer({
		delimiter: Delimiter.Comma,
	})
)

// Same as before, but we grab the iterator.
const iterator = reader[Symbol.asyncIterator]()

const headerResult = await iterator.next()

const headerColumns = normalizeColumnNames(headerResult.value)

console.log(headerColumns) // ["full_name", "occupation", "age"]
```
